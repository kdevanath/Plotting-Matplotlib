# Plotting-Matplotlib

Observation and insights into drug regimen administered on mice.

What drug is successful and if weight/sex of the mice matters.

Clean the data, look for duplicates

Find the summary stats such as mean, sd, error factors etc

Generate Bar and Py charts showing the ration of female to Male, the number of mice on each regiment

Calculate Quartiles and outliers, also visually show the outliers using baoxplot and whiskers.

Calculate final tumor volume across Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin

Generate plots measuring tumor vol/size by time spend on regimen

Calculate correlation and regression line average tumor size vs. weight of the mice

# Conclusions
The weight and the tumor volume seems to be highly correlated

After 45 days in the  drug regimen Capomulin, there is a general downward trend but nothing to be excited about.

The sample seems to be evenly ditributed between male and female population

The sample  does not have any outliers skewing our results, the sample itself is not big enough.
